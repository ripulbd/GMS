The link to the Guardian article was written by none other than that likable jailbird, the formerly right honourable Chris Huhne, so anything that he says must surely be beyond reproach. The general thrust of the article is that small implies rich, with Mr. Huhne pointing out that France and Germany are well down the international rankings. Of course, this is nothing to do with the fact that a number of these small countries are engaged in a good deal of freeloading (e.g. hiding under the coatails of their larger near neighbours or are not net contributors to the IMF) or by taxing competitively and perhaps aggressively (as Ireland does).
